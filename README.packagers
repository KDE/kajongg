Dependencies for kajongg: Please look at the file debian.control

all content of debian.control is used by make_debian_package,
so its syntax must follow debian package rules

Kajongg uses the wrapper qtpy around PyQt5/PyQt6/Pyside2/Pyside6. If more than one is installed, kajongg uses PyQt5.
The environment variable QT_API can override that, see https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy#requirements

If you see segfaults, Pyside is usually better for finding the reason.
