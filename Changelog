25 Jul 2009 Release 0.3.2
- only show the scoring dialog (enter hand results) if asked for. This
  dialog can now be closed and reopened with CTRL-S without losing
  its content. This is as a preparation for a real playing mode where
  this dialog is not wanted during the game.
- player and games dialog: refine the GUI: Icons on buttons, better button
  order, accept INS key
- do not require sipconfig module anymore
- remove patterns from manual
- many pylintifications
- moving tiles with keyboard ESWNX: ignore key if another modifier than Shift
  is found: CTRL-N must not move to north but start a new game

21 Jul 2009 Release 0.3.1
- convert all rules to regular expressions and remove Pattern code.
  The Pattern code used the unsafe eval. This matters as soon as we

  do it all with regular expressions - they are faster anyway
