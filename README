This is the classical Mah Jongg for four players.
If you are looking for the Mah Jongg solitaire please use the
application kmahjongg.

Right now this program lets you choose the tiles every player
had at the end of a hand. It will then compute the scores and
make the payments between the players. The results are saved
in a database for later consultation, or if you want to continue
a game at a later date.

The ruleset is classical chinese as played in Germany. Right now
this is fixed - I will make this fully configurable. It will also
be possible to define new rulesets. The rules for a game will be
saved in the database, so every game could be played with different
rules.

Some time later, I might implement a real playing mode: play
against the computer or against other players over the network,
just like xmj does.

This program is still in heavy development, so be warned -
it might do unexpected things like erasing your hard disk or
eating your cat.

You can always get the current source code:

svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/playground/games/kmj

---------------------------------
Requirements
---------------------------------

kmj is a true KDE4 application and therefore requires KDE4 as well as
the QT4 libraries.

kmj needs: (debian packages)
- the KDE4 games library (libkdegames5) 
- Python 2.5 or higher (python)
- QT4.4 or higher (libqt4-core, libqt4-gui, libqt4-svg, libqt4-sql, libqt4-sql-sqlite)
- the python bindings for QT4  (python-qt4, python-qt4-sql)
- the python bindings for KDE4 (python-kde4)
- sqlite3 (libsqlite3-0)


---------------------------------
Installing kmj
---------------------------------

use the .deb package or the .rpm package. If they do
not work for you, you can download kmj-x-y.tar.gz and then do:

tar xfz kmj-x-y.tar.gz
cd kmj-x-y
./setup.py install



---------------------------------
Translations
---------------------------------

The basic installation contains all languages for whom there
is a translated comment in kmj.desktop.
Here you can check if there is a translation for you:
http://l10n.kde.org/stats/gui/trunk-kde4/po/kmj.po/

You can download wanted translations like this:
svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/l10n-kde4/XX/messages/playground-games/kmj.po
where XX is the wanted language

Install this file in the right directory. This could be one
of those, or somewhere else depending on your distribution:

$HOME/.kde/share/locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/kmj.mo
/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/kmj.mo
/usr/share/locale-langpack/de/LC_MESSAGES/kmj.mo

When unsure, you can ask the system for the directory with all translations:

kde4-config --install locale # returns /usr/share/locale on my system

If your language is missing or not fully translated, feel free
to translate it!
