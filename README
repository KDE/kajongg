kajongg (covered by the GNU GPL2 license - see COPYING)

This is the classical Mah Jongg for four players.
If you are looking for the Mah Jongg solitaire please use the
application kmahjongg.

Right now this program lets you choose the tiles every player
had at the end of a hand. It will then compute the scores and
make the payments between the players. The results are saved
in a database for later consultation, or if you want to continue
a game at a later date.

kajongg comes with a ruleset for classical chinese as played in Germany.
You can change the ruleset at your will and also define whole new
rulesets. The rules for a game are saved in the database, so every
game could be played with different rules. Changing a ruleset
does not affect existing games.

In the future kajongg will get a real playing mode: play against the
computer or against other players over the network.

This program is still in heavy development, so be warned -
it might do unexpected things like erasing your hard disk or
eating your cat.

You can always get the current source code:

svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/playground/games/kajongg

Installing kajongg
---------------------------------

use the .deb package or the .rpm package. If they do
not work for you, you can download kajongg-x-y.tar.gz and then do:

tar xfz kajongg-x-y.tar.gz
cd kajongg-x-y
./setup.py install



---------------------------------
Translations
---------------------------------

The basic installation contains all languages for whom there
is a translated comment in kajongg.desktop.
Here you can check if there is a translation for you:
http://l10n.kde.org/stats/gui/trunk-kde4/po/kajongg.po/

You can download wanted translations like this:
svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/l10n-kde4/XX/messages/playground-games/kajongg.po
where XX is the wanted language

Install this file in the right directory. This could be one
of those, or somewhere else depending on your distribution:

$HOME/.kde/share/locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/kajongg.mo
/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/kajongg.mo
/usr/share/locale-langpack/de/LC_MESSAGES/kajongg.mo

When unsure, you can ask the system for the directory with all translations:

kde4-config --install locale # returns /usr/share/locale on my system

If your language is missing or not fully translated, feel free
to translate it!
