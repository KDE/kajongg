Kajongg - the classical Mah Jongg for four players. If you are looking for the Mah Jongg solitaire please use the application KMahjongg.

[b][u]Installing Kajongg on Windows[/b][/u]

Download the installer from the link below.

Kajongg needs the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package.
I believe I am not allowed to include a copy in the installer.
Chances are good that you already have this installed. Otherwise
you should see a corresponding error message. You can get that
package from Microsoft here: [url]http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29[/url]

Support for Windows is very new, there might be a few things missing. Still to be done:

- toolbar, statusbar, keyboard shortcuts everywhere

- application language selection. For now, the language of the installed Windows
  is used. If Kajongg is not translated into that language, it is english. If you really
  need to, you can edit a configuration file and select any of the available languages.


[b][u]Installing Kajongg on Linux[/b][/u]

Kajongg is part of the KDE games, your Linux distribution should bring it to you.


[b][u]More[/b][/u]

Kajongg is covered by the GNU GPL2 license - see COPYING.

Kajongg can be used in two different ways: Scoring a manual
game where you play as always and use Kajongg for the computation
of scores and for bookkeeping. Or you can use Kajongg to play
against any combination of other human players or computer players.

Kajongg currently comes with two rulesets for classical chinese, one
for rules in Germany and one for rules in England.
You can change many things in the rulesets at your will.
The rules for a game are saved in the database, so every
game could be played with different rules. Changing a ruleset
does not affect existing games.

You can always get the current source code from here:

git clone https://invent.kde.org/games/kajongg.git
or see online here: [url]https://invent.kde.org/games/kajongg[/url]

If you want to send me bug reports, please either use the kajongg
menu commmand Help / Report Bug or mail me directly to the Mail
Address given in that bug reporting dialog. I will not follow links
to pages I do not trust like upload pages, shortlink services or
similar.
