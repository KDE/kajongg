kmj needs: (debian packages)
- the KDE4 games library (libkdegames5) 
- Python 2.5 or higher (python)
- QT4.4 or higher (libqt4-core, libqt4-gui, libqt4-svg, libqt4-sql)
- the python bindings for QT  (python-qt4, python-qt4-sql)
- the python bindings for KDE4 (python-kde4)
- sqlite3 (libsqlite3-0)

Installing kmj

not work for you, you can do

python setup.py install


---------------------------------
Translations
---------------------------------

The basic installation is english only.
Here you can check if there is a translation for you:
http://l10n.kde.org/stats/gui/trunk-kde4/po/kmj.po/

You can download wanted translations like this:
svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/l10n-kde4/XX/messages/playground-games/kmj.po
where XX is the wanted language

Install this file in the right directory. This could be one
of those, or somewhere else depending on your distribution:

$HOME/.kde/share/locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/kmj.mo
/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/kmj.mo
/usr/share/locale-langpack/de/LC_MESSAGES/kmj.mo

When unsure, you can ask the system for the directory with all translations:

kde4-config --install locale # returns /usr/share/locale on my system

If your language is missing or not fully translated, feel free
to translate it!
