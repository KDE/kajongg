Kajongg - the classical Mah Jongg for four players. If you are looking for the Mah Jongg solitaire please use the application KMahjongg.

Kajongg is covered by the GNU GPL2 license - see COPYING.

Kajongg can be used in two different ways: Scoring a manual
game where you play as always and use Kajongg for the computation
of scores and for bookkeeping. Or you can use Kajongg to play
against any combination of other human players or computer players.

Kajongg comes with a ruleset for classical chinese as played in Germany.
You can change the ruleset at your will and also define whole new
rulesets. The rules for a game are saved in the database, so every
game could be played with different rules. Changing a ruleset
does not affect existing games.

Since KDE SC 4.5 Kajongg is part of the KDE games, so I do not
offer a separate downloadable package anymore. If your favorite
distribution should not yet distribute Kajongg, please ask them
for it. The major distributions like Ubuntu, Opensuse, Fedora do.

You can always get the current source code from here:

svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/KDE/kdegames/kajongg

Please also visit [url]http://kde.org/applications/games/kajongg/[/url]

If you want to send me bug reports, please either use the kajongg
menu commmand Help / Report Bug or mail me directly to the Mail
Address given in that bug reporting dialog. I will not follow links
to pages I do not trust like upload pages, shortlink services or
similar.

[b][u]Requirements[/b][/u]

If you install Kajongg from your Linux distribution, you can skip this.

Kajongg is a true KDE4 application and therefore requires the KDE4 libraries
KDE4 as well as the Qt4 libraries. However you can of course also use it
in a GNOME environment.

Please read debian.control for information about what other software
needs to be installed for using Kajongg.



[b][u]Installing Kajongg[/b][/u]

Again, if you install Kajongg from your Linux distribution, you can skip
this chapter.

First, get the source code as described above.
cd kajongg
./setup.py install



[b][u]Translations[/b][/u]

The above installation will install Kajongg without any translations.
