Kajongg - the classical Mah Jongg for four players. If you are looking for the Mah Jongg solitaire please use the application KMahjongg.

Kajongg is covered by the GNU GPL2 license - see COPYING.

NEW: The game server part now runs on servers without the need
to install KDE. It should also be possible to eliminate the
neeed of Qt4 but since Debian Stable offers Qt4 I see no
need for that.

Kajongg can be used in two different ways: Scoring a manual
game where you play as always and use Kajongg for the computation
of scores and for bookkeeping. Or you can use Kajongg to play
against any combination of other human players or computer players.

Kajongg comes with a ruleset for classical chinese as played in Germany.
You can change the ruleset at your will and also define whole new
rulesets. The rules for a game are saved in the database, so every
game could be played with different rules. Changing a ruleset
does not affect existing games.

You can always get the current source code:

svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/KDE/kdegames/kajongg

If you want to send me bug reports, please either use the kajongg
menu commmand Help / Report Bug or mail me directly to the Mail
Address given in that bug reporting dialog. I will not follow links
to pages I do not trust like upload pages, shortlink services or
similar.

[b][u]Changelog[/b][/u]

please read the separate file Changelog



[b][u]Requirements[/b][/u]

Kajongg is a true KDE4 application and therefore requires the KDE4 libraries
KDE4 as well as the Qt4 libraries. However you can of course also use it
in a GNOME environment.

Please read debian.control for information about what other software
needs to be installed for using Kajongg.



[b][u]Installing Kajongg[/b][/u]

use the .deb package or the .rpm package. If they do
not work for you, you can download kajongg-x-y-z.tar.gz and then do:

tar xfz kajongg-x-y-z.tar.gz
cd kajongg-x-y-z
./setup.py install



[b][u]Translations[/b][/u]

The basic installation contains all languages for whom there
is a translated name in kajongg.desktop.
Here you can check if there is a translation for you:
[url]http://l10n.kde.org/stats/gui/trunk-kde4/po/kajongg.po/[/url]

You can download wanted translations like this:
svn cat svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/l10n-kde4/XX/messages/kdegames/kajongg.po > kajongg.po
where XX is the wanted language

Then run
msgfmt -o kajongg.mo kajongg.po

Install kajongg.mo in the right directory. This could be one
of those, or somewhere else depending on your distribution:

$HOME/.kde/share/locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/kajongg.mo
/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/kajongg.mo
/usr/share/locale-langpack/de/LC_MESSAGES/kajongg.mo

When unsure, you can ask the system for the directory with all translations:

kde4-config --install locale # returns /usr/share/locale on my system

If your language is missing or not fully translated, feel free
to translate it!
